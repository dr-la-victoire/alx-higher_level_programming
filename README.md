This repository contains the files for the ALX SE higher level programming lesson projects.
The following projects are stored in this repository:
1) 0x00. Python - Hello, World: which I think is the introduction to Python
2) 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions: which covers control flow and function creations with python
3) 0x02. Python - import & modules: I think I'm making my own modules and learning about import
4) 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples: We begin the data structure lessons in Python. Yay
5) 0x05. Python - Exceptions: Here, we learned to handle exceptions. The whole try/except syntax
6) 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects: All the work on Object Oriented Programming
7) 0x07. Python - Test-driven development: We're learning the importance of TDD using unitest and doctest. I think it's the test first then code module
